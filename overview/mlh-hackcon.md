# MLH Hackcon

MLH Hackcon is an in-person conference that takes place each year in New York and teaches organizers skills to build their communities and hackathons. We offer busses from the NYC area to a summer camp venue, for a weekend of learning from your peers.&#x20;

MLH Hackcon is not free to attend, but we can help you make it a part of your budget or help you navigate potential resources to cover the cost. Check out an article written about attending for free: [https://news.mlh.io/how-to-attend-hackcon-for-free-using-your-schools-conference-budget-05-24-2023](https://news.mlh.io/how-to-attend-hackcon-for-free-using-your-schools-conference-budget-05-24-2023)&#x20;
