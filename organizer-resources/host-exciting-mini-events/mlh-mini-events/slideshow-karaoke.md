# Slideshow Karaoke

An improv activity where the presenter is given a randomly selected presentation. The presentation can either be a real slideshow \(from [slideserve.com](http://slideserve.com)\) or a set of real slides from a different presentation that are nonsensical when assembled together, or slides that are nonsensical on their own \(in some cases created by randomly downloading images from the internet and adding unrelated text\).

## **Note:** Make sure youâ€™re the one selecting the slideshow. If not, let participants know beforehand that it needs to follow the Code of Conduct.
