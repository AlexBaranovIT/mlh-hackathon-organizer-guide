# !Light

This is a frontend coding competition we borrowed without asking and renamed it '!Light', exactly the same as Code in the Dark.

* Each round lasts 10 minutes, and is between 5 to 10 participants
* All participants in each round are given the same screenshot of a website \(e.g: Pinterest.com\) and must recreate it to the best of their ability in HTML & CSS
* No code completion tools, no syntax highlighting, no compiling your code before 10 minutes
* Direct participants go to [http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENT](http://no-light.mlh.io/YOUREVENT)
* All screens are mirrored so that the audience can watch and alert any rule-breaking
* The winner will be chosen by audience applause \(so bring your friends!\)
* Add .zip to the link above to review submissions
