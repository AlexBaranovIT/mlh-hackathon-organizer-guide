# MS Paint Bob Ross

MS Paint Bob Ross is MLH's new favourite mini-event and hopefully yours too. You’ll be watching a Bob Ross video alongside hackers and creating a masterpiece.

## **Pro Tips**

* You should paint something alongside the hackers and Bob Ross. You get to participate too.
* Regularly check in with folks and schmooze a bit. This should be a silly interactive stream.
* Make sure hackers know they’re going to post their creations at the end.

## **Setup**

* Make sure you’re logged into the appropriate Zoom account
* Head to [https://www.twitch.tv/bobross/videos](https://www.twitch.tv/bobross/videos)
* Open up [https://jspaint.app/](https://jspaint.app/)
* Find a video to use for your event. Your choice!

## **Running the Event**

* Share the video you selected with hackers and ask them to queue up the video. 
* Have hackers open up [https://jspaint.app/](https://jspaint.app/) or the paint application of their choice. 
* Share your screen so hackers can see you painting if they’d like to.
* Do a countdown for the video and have everyone follow along together. 
* At the end, have hackers take turns sharing their screens to showcase their work or consider posting them in a public channel of some sort!
