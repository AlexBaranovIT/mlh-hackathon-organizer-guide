# WereWolf

A group of wagons crawl along a path on a dark, starless night. Your caravan master’s constantly scanning the skies for proof he runs the correct course. A single lantern his only protection facing the black of night.

To everyone’s dismay, the skies offer you no guidance in these dark times. Werewolves are on the loose.

Your caravan carries travellers bound for the west fleeing the threat these monsters present. Fleeing what remains of their home in Edmond’s Field… desperately grasping at a clean beginning. The town Seer and Doctor travel amongst you offering a short breath of relief. Though the rumors of a young Witch hiding in your ranks raise your guard once more.

You hear yelling ahead as the caravan stops abruptly. The crowd finds me lying dead mauled by werewolves. They are amongst you. You will travel no further this evening.

### **The Werewolves**

Typically werewolves are outnumbered by villagers 2 to 1. So a game of 6 players would have 2 werewolves. The goal of the werewolves is to decide together on one villager to secretly kill off during the night while posing as villagers during the day so they're not killed off themselves. One by one they'll kill off villagers and win when there are either the same number of villagers and werewolves left, or all the villagers have died. This role is the hardest of all to maintain because these players are lying for the duration of the game.

### The Seer

The Seer, while first and foremost a villager, has the added ability to "see" who the werewolves are once night falls. When called awake by the Moderator, the Seer can point to any of their fellow players and the Moderator must nod yes or no as to whether or not they are indeed a Werewolf. The Seer can then choose to keep this information a secret during the day, or reveal themselves as the Seer and use the knowledge they gained during the night in their defence or to their advantage during the day. The strategy here is up to you.

### The Doctor

Also a villager, the Doctor has the ability to heal themselves or another villager when called awake by the Moderator during the night. Should they heal themselves, they will be safe from being killed by the werewolves, or should they want to prove themselves the Doctor or fear the death of a fellow villager, can opt to heal them instead? Again, the strategy here is up to you.

### The Witch

This role, while first and foremost taking on all the elements of a regular Villager throughout the game, also has the additional powers of one potion and one poison, which they may use at any point throughout the game. When the Witch is added, the Moderator will wake them up separately during the night with, “The Witch comes awake…” and follows this with “The Witch brings someone back to life.” and “The Witch poisons someone.” The Witch will then point to the person they want to poison or bring back to life. While the Witch can only use their potion and poison once, each action must be said each night to retain anonymity as to what has been done. They can only use one per evening until both are gone, and have the ability to save them until a point in the game they deem fit.

## **Running the event:**

### **Script:**

A group of wagons crawl along a path on a dark, starless night. Your caravan master’s constantly scanning the skies for proof he runs the correct course. A single lantern his only protection facing the black of night.

To everyone’s dismay, the skies offer you no guidance in these dark times. Werewolves are on the loose.

Your caravan carries travelers bound for the west fleeing the threat these monsters present. Fleeing what remains of their home in Edmond’s Field… desperately grasping at a clean beginning. The town Seer and Doctor travel amongst you offering a short breath of relief. Though the rumors of a young Witch hiding in your ranks raise your guard once more. 

You hear yelling ahead as the caravan stops abruptly. The crowd finds me lying dead mauled by werewolves. They are amongst you. You will travel no further this evening. 

## **Roles:**

### **Moderator**

* **Overview/Ability:** 1 moderator per game \(typically you, the MLHer\). In charge of story role playing, setting the tone of the game, walking through each of the role's abilities per night.
  * You MUST prompt each role to awaken even if they are no longer active in the game. 
* **How to:** 
  * During each night, all players must "sleep" \(aka close their eyes or turn off their webcam\). One at a time, call awakes by opening their eyes \(in person\) or DMs the moderator with webcam off \(digitally\):
    * The werewolves awaken to uniformly choose who to kill. Werewolves open eyes and point silently \(inperson\) or Werewolves DM moderator their votes \(digitally\). Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
    * The seer awakens and points to or DMs you a person's name, and you must respond with Yes/No if they are a werewolf. Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
    * The doctor awakens and they choose anyone currently alive to heal. They are allowed to heal themselves. Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
    * The witch awakens and can choose to use one of their potions by pointing at someone or DMing their name. Then, prompt to go back to sleep.
  * Day comes, and you must report any deaths during the night. Possible scenarios:
    * "During the night, \_\_\_\_ has been killed by the werewolves"
    * "During the night, \_\_\_\_\_\_ was found limp in the park close to death, but then a mysterious doctor passed by saving them before it was too late"
    * "The witch poisoned/saved \_\_\_\_\_\_"
  * Repeat until the end of the game \(e.g. no more werewolves or if there is one werewolf left with a villager\).
