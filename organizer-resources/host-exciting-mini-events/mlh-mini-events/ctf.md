### **Recruiting Participants for the Challenge:**

As usual with mini-events, going around and drumming up excitement before your mini-event is a good idea. Make an announcement in Slack/Discord for the event, and then go around physically getting hackers interested. Here’s an example of what to say:

> "Hey friendos! At \[time\], we’re going to be running the US Airforce Cybersecurity Challenge over in \[room\]. It’ll be fun whether you’re a pro hacker or have never written a line of code in your life. See you there!”

You may also wish to hint to some hackers that you’ll be giving out shirts at the mini-event as an extra incentive. Just be aware that yelling that too loudly might lead to half the hackathon being at your mini-event.

### Running the Mini-**E**vent:

The challenge is divided into 3 separate components. The cool thing about that is you should run as many challenges as you deem appropriate. If your hackers are really struggling to get through the first 2 challenges, you can stop and encourage them to check out challenge 3 if they’re curious. If your hackers seem really into it, then run all 3! They’re all designed to be very simple and standalone.

With that in mind, tell the hackers to sign in with their MyMLH \(and to quickly make an account if they don’t have one.\) After that, have everyone pop open the first challenge and tell them to get started -- and that you’ll be dropping hints in a few minutes if they don’t know where to start.

For framing the event, read this \(or put it in your own words\):

> With Capture the Flags \(or CTF’s\) and cybersecurity, a lot of it is building experience so you know what to look for in the future. Even if you don't know what's going on now, you're amassing knowledge for future CTFs. You’re looking for a flag that looks like “flag{something}”, where “something” is the key you type in to complete the challenge.

### **Giving out prizes:**

Recommended way to give out the prizes is a raffle for everyone who participated. You’ll have 3 prizes for your event -- so do 3 drawings, with the 1st person getting first picks at a prize. 

To set up the raffle, you can usually pretty easily just take everyone’s names down and then use random.org to get your random drawings. Don’t let one person win multiple prizes.
