# Setting Goals - Understanding your Sponsors

You’ll be targeting five types of sponsors:

* Financial — Cash for services. Most sponsors fall into this category.
* Presenting — Sponsors that co-host or co-brand your event. \(Be careful not to give up too much control here.\)
* Strategic partners — Sponsors that help with marketing and promotion; often publications.
* In-kind — Donor companies. They can contribute hardware, t-shirts, etc.

Sponsors support hackathons for three primary reasons:

* To get real time feedback on their development products, especially APIs
* To raise awareness \(or change the perception\) of their brand
* To recruit interns and full-time employees, especially during the fall

Sponsors’ top practical concerns:

* Attendee value
  * Are your hackathon’s attendees a good fit for the company in terms of recruiting, marketing, etc.?
  * How hard is it for companies to reach this audience without your help?
* Who else is sponsoring?
  * Depending on the sponsor, your other backers matter. Some companies prefer to sponsor events their competitors sponsor, whereas others want to ensure they’re the biggest name on your roster.
* Package Value
  * Are they getting their money’s worth?
* The Force \(a.k.a. their gut\)
  * How do the sponsors feel about your competency: is the event well-organized so far? Have you been professional in all communications?
