# How to Promote Your Event

Word of mouth

When promoting your hackathon, it’s useful to keep in mind that most events have a 50 to 30 percent drop-off in attendance. Given these stats, it’s your goal to over-market and overbook!

## Tell Your Hackathon’s Story

What’s your hackathon’s "brand?" How is it unique? Why would _you_ want to attend?

* The more tailored your message, the better. Make it school-specific.
* Use the same messaging to stay consistent and build momentum
* Highlight hackathon benefits perks and the ease of attending: it’s free of cost, transportation will be provided, etc.

It would be great to include a short case study or example "about us" page from a successful hackathon here to show, rather than just tell, organizers how effective branding works.
