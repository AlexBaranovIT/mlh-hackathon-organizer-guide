# How to Promote Your Event

When promoting your hackathon, it’s useful to keep in mind that most events have a 50 to 30 percent drop-off in attendance. Given these stats, it’s your goal to over-market and overbook!

## Tell Your Hackathon’s Story

What’s your hackathon’s "brand?" How is it unique? Why would _you_ want to attend?

* The more tailored your message, the better. Make it school-specific.
* Use the same messaging to stay consistent and build momentum
* Highlight hackathon benefits perks and the ease of attending: it’s free of cost, transportation will be provided, etc.

It would be great to include a short case study or example "about us" page from a successful hackathon here to show, rather than just tell, organizers how effective branding works.

## Getting the Word Out

We've outlined below strategies you can use as you're spreading the word about your event. 

* Invite students from other schools to attend
  * Select at least three schools within six hours of your campus
  * Look at schools that have previously hosted MLH hackathons
  * Select at least three schools within six hours of your campus
  * Don’t overlook community colleges — they’re often rife with promising participants
* Reach out to student groups and departments on all campuses
  * Groups: ACM & IEEE, SWE, SHPE, etc.
  * Departments: computer science, design, engineering and applied math, physics
* Speak in-person during the first 5 minutes of relevant classes and student group meetings on your campus.
  * Explain what it is, why they should care, when and where it’s being held, and how they can get more info.
* Launch a social media campaign
