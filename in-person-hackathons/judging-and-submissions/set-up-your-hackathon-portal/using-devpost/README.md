# Using Devpost

You can setup a Devpost page for your in-person hackathon and manage submissions, judging, and assigning winners entirely for free. To create your hackathon page:

1. Sign into your Devpost account and hover over your profile image in the top right corner. Select "**Manage hackathons**".
2. On the next page you can view all the hackathons you have created. To create a new hackathon page click "**Post a new in-person hackathon**".
3. Once you enter the name of your hackathon and the date you want hackers to start submitting click "**Create my draft hackathon**".
4. From there, you can start filling out your draft hackathon page. Once you're ready to publish it to the world click the yellow "Publish" button in your hackathon dashboard.
