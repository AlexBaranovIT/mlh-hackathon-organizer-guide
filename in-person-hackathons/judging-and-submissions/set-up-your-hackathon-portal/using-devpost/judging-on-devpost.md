# Judging on Devpost

Devpost has two different judging options:

**Online judging** allows you to have judges sign up for Devpost accounts, login, and review projects based on the judging criteria you set.

**Offline judging** allows you to run judging however you want. This can be through expos, demos, presentations, or any combination of other judging methods. Once hackers submit, you can export the submission data to a CSV file which will allow you to use it for your judging process.
