# Judging PlanDay-of: Running Judging

Judging has always been the biggest pain point for every hackathon organizer. This is due to the fact that while planning out the event, other than recruiting and finalising the judges, assign a certain time for judging, organising do not plan anything further, assuming everything can be managed on the day-of. But, in reality, if planned right, judging can be one of the easiest and the most smooth aspect of any hackathon.

At digital events, we've seen hackers working on smaller teams, resulting in a larger number of projects overall. As for any hackathon, our recommendation is always towards implementing a science-fair type of judging plan. This helps in saving time but is a little bit heavier on the logistics side.

## Science Fair Style Judging

In this particular judging style, assume your hackathon to be a science fair and every hacker team setting up their stall at assigned table numbers. Hackers present their hackathon project in front of the judges one by one as they arrive at their stalls, and judges score them accordingly. This way every hackathon attendee is getting a chance to demo in front of the judges and have the experience of presenting at the hackathon. To implement this in a digital world we would recommend you follow the below-mentioned steps.

### Time Requirement

Towards the end of the hackathon, take out some buffer time for the judging. This usually takes around 2 - 3 hours, depending on the number of submissions and judges.

### Calculating the required number of Judges

A typical calculation for the number of judges looks like follows:  
  
 $$J = ⌈P * n * t / T⌉$$   
  
Where,  
 $$J = $$ Number of Judges  
 $$P = $$ Number of Submitted Projects  
 $$n = $$ Number of Judges for each project \(or number of rounds of judging per project\)  
            \(MLH recommendation: 3 rounds per project\)  
 $$t = $$ Time taken by a Judge per project \(MLH recommendation: 5 mins per project\)  
 $$T = $$ Total time allocated for Judging \(in minutes\)  


For eg.: Consider you have **150 projects submitted** at your hackathon and you have **allocated 2 hours for judging**. As per our recommendation, we are having **3 rounds of judging** per project and **5 minutes are allocated per project** for a judge to take their decision.  
  
Now the calculation looks like:  
  
 $$J = ⌈150 * 3 * 5 / 120⌉ = ⌈18.75⌉ = 19$$   
  
Hence the number of **judges required is 19**.

### Allocating Projects

Allocating projects is more logistically heavy in a science fair style of judging because each judge cannot see every project \(compared to what happened in the past\). 

To most efficiently allocate projects, I’d recommend manually dividing the total number of projects by the number of judges. Then the result is how many projects each judge will see during the judging period. 

### Choosing Winners: 

There're plenty of options with finalizing winners, but at MLH, we love to use Stack Ranking because it reduces a judges’ previous biases. 

To do stack ranking, you’ll ask each judge to see their subset of projects, then give the organizers their Top 3 projects, in order. As organizers, you’ll assign 3 points to First Place, 2 to Second Place, and 1 to Third Place. 

After all of the scores have come in, you’ll sort all of the scores in descending order. Then, the projects at the top will be your winning projects!
