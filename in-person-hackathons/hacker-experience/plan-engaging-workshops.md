# Plan Engaging Workshops

As a hackathon organizer, you have to figure out the budget, create the schedule, contact sponsors, and more. While you're creating the schedule, you think that your hackers might benefit from a fun and educational workshop. You also want your workshop to appeal to hackers with different experience levels. But your team is already busy managing everything else. The last thing you need to worry about is finding time to prepare slides, dig through API documentation, and setup a development environment to make a presentation.
