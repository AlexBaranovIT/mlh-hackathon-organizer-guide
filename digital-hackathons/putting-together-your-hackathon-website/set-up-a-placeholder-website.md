# Placeholder Website

Until an event has a website, it doesn’t exist to most people. Publishing a basic website the second you’ve committed to hosting a hackathon will help you drive interest to it, capture potential attendee email addresses, and answer questions from interested students:

The first iteration of your site should include:

* Dates \(if you have them\)
* A pre-registration form. \(A few good options for this include SendGrid and LaunchRock.\)
* A designated email address to answer potential attendees’ questions
* Links to your event’s Facebook, Instagram, and Twitter account
* A date when visitors should check back for more info
* A basic FAQ about your event to explain things to someone who has never seen or been to a hackathon before. A good FAQ example: [MLH Prime](http://prime.mlh.io/#faqs)
* A page just for sponsors, including:
  * An email address for sponsorship inquiries
  * Some information about your event and your team
