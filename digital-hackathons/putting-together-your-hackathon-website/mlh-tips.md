# MLH Tips and Resources

## **MLH Tips:** 

* You should update this site on a rolling basis as you land speakers and sponsors, create your schedule, confirm transportation offerings, etc.
* As early as possible, [celebrate what differentiates your event](http://guide.mlh.io/Organizer-Timeline/2-Months-Before/Promote-Your-Event.html).
* It's never too early to open registration. Check out [MyMLH](http://my.mlh.io) for an awesome single sign on solution to make signing up for your hackathon really simple!

### Resources:

* [MLH-Hackathon-Boilerplate](https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-boilerplate) - Boilerplate code for any new MLH Member Hackathon looking to build a website integrated with MyMLH. Written entirely in **Jekyll**, which [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) automatically compiles to make hosting seamless.
