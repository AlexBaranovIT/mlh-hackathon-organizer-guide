# Ordering Swags & Prizes

When it comes to prizes and swag, you should do what your budget allows. If you have a significant budget surplus, consider sending swag bags to everyone who submitted a project at your event, this can be as low cost as $5 per participant. It’s a great way to encourage them to demo, and helps you make the event more memorable.

If you plan to do this, remember to collect t-shirt sizes and shipping addresses.

If you don’t have the budget to ship everyone something, you can send a package to each university club that participated and have them handle the distribution when it is once again safe to gather. That should keep shipping \(and labor\) low, while letting you allocate your budget toward something high-impact. 

Keep in mind however you’re shipping, this doesn’t need to happen directly after your online event. We encourage you to take a few days off to rest and recover before you start the shipping process. 

_Contact your Hackathon Community Manager \(league@mlh.io\) for help on shipping, as we can ship for you MLH has tons of experience with getting swag packed and sent._
