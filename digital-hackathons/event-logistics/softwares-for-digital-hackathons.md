# Softwares for digital Hackathons

## **Communication Platform**

**Pick a communication platform and ensure your hackers join it**. Slack and Discord are two of the most popular. We recommend Discord for your virtual events because of their free voice chat capabilities.

Before joining and once on the platform, make hackers know that their behavior and actions are still subject to MLH Code of Conduct, and to be respectful. _Digital spaces can increase harassment as people are hidden behind a computer, so it is key to make sure your attendees know you still take this seriously._
