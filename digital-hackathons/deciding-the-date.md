# Finding the Date & Purpose

As you begin to plan your digital hackathon, it's important to think about the purpose of your event. Brainstorm with your organizing team the _why_ behind your event. This will help as you make decisions while planning your hackathon.

After you've solidified the purpose of your event, it's time to pick out a date! Things to consider as you choose your date are:

* Major events at your university 
* Major holidays and festivals 
* University breaks 
* Dates of other hackathons that serve your community 
* Dates of major exams at your university
