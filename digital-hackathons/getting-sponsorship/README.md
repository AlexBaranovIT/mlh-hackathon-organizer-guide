# Getting Sponsorship

Sponsors can get much of the same value from a digital event as they can an in-person one. Prize categories and workshops can both be run much the same, though sponsors should practice running their workshop through streaming or pre-recorded video. Give them their own channel on Slack/Discord to talk to hackers, and have them introduce themselves so everyone knows who they are. As long as they’re online answering questions from hackers about their company/prize category/workshop/anything else they’re doing that weekend, they’ll have a lot of great interactions with hackers. We also strongly recommend doing office hours with sponsors.

As many companies are recommending their employees do not travel to events right now, we don’t anticipate much pushback from sponsors. However, be diligent to communicate with your sponsors at every step of the process. Explain to them the reasons for making your event digital, outline how you will support them throughout the event, and let them know about the success at other digital events.
