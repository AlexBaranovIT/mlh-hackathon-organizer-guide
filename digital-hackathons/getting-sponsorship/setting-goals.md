# Understanding your Sponsors - Setting Goals



You’ll be targeting five types of sponsors:

* Financial — Cash for services. Most sponsors fall into this category.
* Presenting — Sponsors that co-host or co-brand your event. \(Be careful not to give up too much control here.\)
* Anchor brands — These companies make you legit in the eye of other sponsors.
* Strategic partners — Sponsors that help with marketing and promotion; often publications.
* In-kind — Donor companies. They can contribute hardware, t-shirts, etc.

Sponsors support hackathons for three primary reasons:

* To get real time feedback on their development products, especially APIs
* To raise awareness \(or change the perception\) of their brand
* To recruit interns and full-time employees, especially during the fall

Sponsors’ top practical concerns:

* Cost per attendee — sponsors want this to be low, while you want this to be as high as possible while keeping their support.
* Attendee value
  * Are your hackathon’s attendees a good fit for the company in terms of recruiting, marketing, etc.?
  * How hard is it for companies to reach this audience without your help?
* Who else is sponsoring?
  * Depending on the sponsor, your other backers matter. Some companies prefer to sponsor events their competitors sponsor, whereas others want to ensure they’re the biggest name on your roster.
* Package Value
  * Are they getting their money’s worth?
* The Force \(a.k.a.\) their gut
  * How do the sponsors feel about your competency: is the event well-organized so far? Have you been professional in all communications?

#### **Office Hours**

If your sponsors are running a prize track, ask them to host office hours where hackers can ask questions, get feedback, and chat with them about the track.

#### **Workshops**

If a sponsor was planning on hosting a workshop at your in-person event, encourage them to do the same digitally. See [our MLH Localhost recommendations](https://news.mlh.io/bringing-your-mlh-localhost-workshop-online-03-16-2020%28opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab%29) for help on hosting remote workshops. 

#### **Fun and Games** 

As you’re hosting games and competitions throughout the event, consider mixing it up with sponsor vs hacker vs organizers challenges! If your sponsor isn’t as interested in a technical workshops, see if they’re interested in hosting a mini-event or game. 

#### **Recruiting** 

Keep in mind that even though hackathons are cancelling, hackers still are looking for jobs. If a sponsor is primarily interested in recruiting, there are still ways to engage them. Some ideas include:

* **Resume critiques** – Office hours where recruiters help hackers edit and perfect their resumes. 
* **1:1 Recruiter/Sponsor Chats** – Set up Google Hangouts or Zoom breakout rooms for your hackers to meet companies one on one, similarly to how they would at a sponsor fair. 
* **Interviews –** If you’re providing resumes in advance, your recruiters may be interested in interviewing your hackers during the event, similarly to how they would at an in-person event. Assist them with setting up technology to facilitate these interviews.
