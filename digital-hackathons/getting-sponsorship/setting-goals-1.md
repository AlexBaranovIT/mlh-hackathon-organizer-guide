# Setting Goals

## **Office Hours**

If your sponsors are running a prize track, ask them to host office hours where hackers can ask questions, get feedback, and chat with them about the track.

## **Workshops**

If a sponsor was planning on hosting a workshop at your in-person event, encourage them to do the same digitally. See [our MLH Localhost recommendations](https://news.mlh.io/bringing-your-mlh-localhost-workshop-online-03-16-2020%28opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab%29) for help on hosting remote workshops.

## **Fun and Games**

As you’re hosting games and competitions throughout the event, consider mixing it up with sponsor vs hacker vs organizers challenges! If your sponsor isn’t as interested in technical workshops, see if they’re interested in hosting a mini-event or game.

## **Recruiting**

If a sponsor is primarily interested in recruiting, there are several ways to engage them. Some ideas include:

* **Resume critiques** – Office hours where recruiters help hackers edit and perfect their resumes. 
* **1:1 Recruiter/Sponsor Chats** – Set up Google Hangouts or Zoom breakout rooms for your hackers to meet companies one on one, similarly to how they would at a sponsor fair. 
* **Interviews –** If you’re providing resumes in advance, your recruiters may be interested in interviewing your hackers during the event, similarly to how they would at an in-person event. Assist them with setting up technology to facilitate these interviews.
