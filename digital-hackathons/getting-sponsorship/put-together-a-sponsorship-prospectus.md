# Put Together A Sponsorship Prospectus

Before approaching sponsors, create a short info packet with three tiers of sponsorship. This doesn’t need to be fancy — just explain what a hackathon is and how they can prepare to get the most out of it. You should make it clear what you are providing, and mention a few things sponsors have done at other hackathons that you thought were awesome.

Your prospectus should include:

* The basics: date, number of expected attendees, etc.
* The story behind your event, an introduction to your team, and a note about what you’re trying to accomplish, as well as what makes your event special. What are its differentiating factors?
* An overview of available sponsorships — what companies get and how much it will cost them.
  * We recommend including three sponsorship tiers: reasonable, moderate, and expensive. \(Anyone tier should not comprise more than 25 per cent of your budget.\)
  * Let companies know custom packages are available.

Be sure to include the following info on _all_ materials — we can’t tell you how many times this gets overlooked!

* Event name
* Date
* Projected attendance
* Website URL
* Contact email
