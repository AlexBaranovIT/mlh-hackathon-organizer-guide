# Plan Engaging Workshops

### **Workshops** 

Weâ€™ve [created a guide on how to remotely run workshops](https://news.mlh.io/bringing-your-mlh-localhost-workshop-online-03-16-2020). Check it out for tips on streaming and presenting to a remote crowd. 

The biggest thing to remember is to ensure your presenters test their streaming setup. If they are having trouble streaming video and audio, consider sharing their slides out to participants and only streaming audio. 

As a hackathon organizer, you have to figure out the budget, create the schedule, contact sponsors, and more. While you're creating the schedule, you think that your hackers might benefit from a fun and educational workshop. You also want your workshop to appeal to hackers with different experience levels. But your team is already busy managing everything else. The last thing you need to worry about is finding time to prepare slides, dig through API documentation, and setup a development environment to make a presentation.

There's no need to fear, MLH [Localhost is here](https://localhost.mlh.io)! Localhost provides workshops that you can use right out of the box.
