# Plan Engaging Workshops

### **Workshops** 

Weâ€™ve [created a guide on how to remotely run workshops](https://news.mlh.io/bringing-your-mlh-localhost-workshop-online-03-16-2020). Check it out for tips on streaming and presenting to a remote crowd. 

The biggest thing to remember is to ensure your presenters test their streaming setup. If they are having trouble streaming video and audio, consider sharing their slides out to participants and only streaming audio.
