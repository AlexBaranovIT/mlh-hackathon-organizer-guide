# Running your Workshops

### **Workshops**

If your workshop material isn’t interactive, consider pre-recording it, streaming it, and answering questions live. For more interactive material, you can have presenters run it for small groups on Zoom or Twitch. If it’s more of a working session, doing it entirely in text is also an option.
