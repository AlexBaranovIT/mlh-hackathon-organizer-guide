# Running Opening ceremony

## **Opening**

We strongly recommend pre-recording your opening ceremony rather than doing it live. It lets you be in full control of the ceremony, removes a lot of hardware/bandwidth problems, and, in general, is significantly more consistent.

Make sure you cover:

* General Slack/Discord etiquette
* The event schedule
* Prize categories
* How to reach out to the organizers on Slack/Discord if they have questions
* Any sponsor content
* Your MLH Coach’s pre-recorded video

Your designated MLH Coach will also send you a pre-recorded video making sure to explain the Code of Conduct, our prize categories, and what mini-events we will be running digitally.

You can edit these videos together on YouTube or iMovie \(Mac\) or just play them sequentially on the stream. _If you pre-record your video, we’ve found music and video can make it much more engaging. Make sure to use royalty-free music!_
