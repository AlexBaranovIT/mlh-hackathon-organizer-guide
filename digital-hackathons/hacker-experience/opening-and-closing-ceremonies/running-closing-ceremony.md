# Running Closing Ceremony

Once you’ve selected your winners for the event, make another announcement saying that closing will be starting soon. Select your most charismatic organizer, and have them start streaming your closing ceremony. Talking over slides is the best format for this. In advance, ask your sponsors to give you a list of their prize winners. Announce these live on the same platform you used for opening, making sure to inject a lot of energy and excitement into your announcements! This is a big moment for your event, and ending strong is super important — people tend to remember the beginning and the end of an event afterward for years to come. _Make sure you celebrate all the hackers were able to build and what that means._
