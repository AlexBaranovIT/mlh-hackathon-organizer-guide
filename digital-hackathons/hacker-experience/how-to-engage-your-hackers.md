# How to Engage your Hackers

At an in-person event, you can quickly communicate with people in the same room as you. At a digital event, you’ll need to set up an environment so people feel comfortable starting conversations like they would in-person.

Having a Slack/Discord is essential. Create separate channels for groups, teams, and interests. We also suggest your organizing team is active on these platforms to help facilitate conversations, moderate threads, and get people chatting. This also makes your hackathon more accessible for people who have a hard time in large groups.

Some of the channels to include are: 

* announcements
* \#README
* introductions 
* random 
* mentors 

Don’t forget to ask folks in Discord/Slack set status/roles to show if they are organizers, hackers, sponsors, or mentors. 

#### **Organizer on Call** 

Have an organizer in a voice chat at all times. Tell hackers and sponsors they can hop on the chat to ask questions or just hang out. 

#### **Updates**

Send updates via Slack/Discord throughout the event. Remind people when activities are happening and share highlights from your activities!
