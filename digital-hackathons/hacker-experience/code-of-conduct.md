# Code of Conduct

Ensuring a safe environment is just as important at a digital event. Creating a space free of abuse and harassment starts with ensuring your hackers agree to the [MLH Code of Conduct](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf). The Major League Hacking Incident Response team is treating all incidents at digital events with the same level of seriousness that we treat any incident. Your MLH Coach will be online to help handle incidents, and as always, our Incidents hotline will be available at all hours \(contact information [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf)\).   


In addition to your MLH Coach helping moderate your Slack/Discord, ensure that at least one organizer is actively moderating all chats throughout the event. If anything is posted that violates the Code of Conduct, screenshot it and delete as quickly as possible as you contact your MLH Coach.   


To prevent any potential violations, your MLH Coach will stress the importance of maintaining a safe space during their pre-recorded opening ceremony presentation \(we'll touch on this more later\). We also encourage you to remind hackers of how seriously you’re treating incidents in pre-event communication as well as your own team’s opening ceremony.
