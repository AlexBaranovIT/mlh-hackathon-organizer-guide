# Sending Reminders

A week before your hackathon is the perfect time to remind everyone involved about what needs to happen. Be sure to reach out to: 

* Attendees — Send clear instructions about when and where to check-in.
* Sponsors — Sponsors also need clear instructions about when and where to check-in. 
* Volunteers and fellow organizers — confirm all volunteer sign-up and designated duties. Send clear instructions about when and where to report.
* Judges and speakers - check-in times and overview of what they should expect day-of.
