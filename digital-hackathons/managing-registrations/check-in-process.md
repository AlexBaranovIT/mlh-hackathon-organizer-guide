# Check-in Process

Even though your event is digital, it's important to have a clear check-in process day-of so you know who is attending. This data is valuable for your team and stakeholders in your event. For your team, it gives you a clear demarcation of who actually attended the event and finally who submitted. These stats help you know what exactly has been the reach for your event. For the sponsors, this data is again highly beneficial to know how many people actually got to know about their offering vs how many utilized them.

If you have already gathered all the fields you need from attendees, there a ton of ways to gather check-ins. Examples include Discord bots, Google forms, and Typeform. If you have a separate registration platform, building in a small check in button that reveals all the day of information and links is a great way to get this done.

If you missed a data category like address or age at registration, you can use check-in as an opportunity to get that info.
