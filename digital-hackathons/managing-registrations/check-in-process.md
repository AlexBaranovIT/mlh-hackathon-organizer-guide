# Check-in process

Even though your event is digital, it's important to have a clear check-in process day-of so you know who is attending. This data is valuable for your team and stakeholders in your event. 

If you have already gathered all the fields you need from attendees, there a ton of ways to gather check-ins. Examples include discord bots, Google forms, and Typeform. If you do not have all of the info that you need \(for example, if you forgot to ask for  a shipping address\), this is a great chance to send out a quick form and have hackers fill it out to check-in. 

[Here](https://majorleaguehacking.typeform.com/to/HxLpsQjl) is an example check-in form.
