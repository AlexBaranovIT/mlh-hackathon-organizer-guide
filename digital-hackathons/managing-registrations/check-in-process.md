# Check-in Process

Even though your event is digital, it's important to have a clear check-in process day-of so you know who is attending. This data is valuable for your team and stakeholders in your event.

If you have already gathered all the fields you need from attendees, there a ton of ways to gather check-ins. Examples include Discord bots, Google forms, and Typeform.

If you missed a data category like address or age at registraiton, you can use check-in as an opportunity to get that info.
