# Build Your Leadership Team

Every first-rate hackathon has an exceptional leadership team behind it. When selecting yours, **think like a startup CEO: choose enthusiastic and smart people with complementary skills**. Think your hackathon as your product and your team as the people putting it together. Hereâ€™s what a typical hackathon leadership team looks like:

* **Hackathon Lead Organiser:** The person in-charge on all the happenings in and around the hackathon. They look after the entire team making decisions on what will be the next best steps in a particular situation. 
* **Logistics Team:** This team is responsible for all logistics of the hackathon like booking the venue, developing and making the schedule, ordering swag, prizes, food and other essentials for the event etc.
* **Finance Team:** This team is responsible for securing sponsorships, making sure the vendors get paid according to the agreed timelines and managing the cash flow and budget.
* **Marketing Team:** This team is in charge of promoting the event, deciding the marketing strategy, developing the website, handling social media etc.
* **Operations Team:** This team is responsible for the hacker experience at the hackathon. Every aspect of what the hackathon looks and feels like, this team is entirely responsible for that. Keep in mind, hacker experience is usually the thing that can make or break your hackathon. We might like to call this the think tank of your hackathon team.

## MLH Tips

* To avoid confusion and increase efficiency, make _one person_ responsible for each team, managing the different day to day task within it. 
* To accurately track progress, encourage transparency among team leaders. Consider creating a status spreadsheet that each person can update on a daily or weekly basis. Using project management tools like Notion, Trello, Basecamp etc. can also be greatly useful here.
