# Run-Through with the Team

Just like a play or a wedding, itâ€™s important to rehearse your schedule once with all team members.

* Create and distribute a [run-of-show document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e2B4-AYUU3Y0xFmiTGLYfRosP2IdXxF1Ud5GvGh-6cE/edit?usp=sharing) with everyone on your team. 
* Confirm roles and report times for each team member.
* Walk-through the run-of-show document on a call with your team.
  * In order to check comprehension, have the primary person responsible for each task read it and say what they need to do. 

## MLH Tips

* Keep in mind most organizers, especially team leaders, will be responsible for more than one thing
* Hackathon schedules inevitably change. Ensure that someone is responsible for updating attendeees, sponsors, volunteers, mentors, and any other stakeholders of schedule changes as well as answering attendee questions in real time.
