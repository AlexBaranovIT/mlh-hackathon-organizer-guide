# Hackathon Scheduling

Having a schedule is essential for organising any event be it organised digitally or in-person. A schedule gives the attendees an idea about what to expect during the event and what might be the things they need to focus upon. For the organizer side, instead of just a schedule, you should have a proper **Run of Show** of the event, which contains additional information about the different small activities, setup and misc. things you might need to do during the course of the whole event. This gives you as organizers clarity about what needs to be done at what specific time bu whom within the reducing most of the load on the day-of.

## The Run of Show

A [detailed run of show](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vf9U34wsp5pklfvwDtV9yGEfm32jpmSLRa0tTWxm3m4/edit?usp=sharing) is essential to running a smooth hackathon whether digital or in-person. This is a timeline including the official hackathon schedule and a secondary staff schedule denoting what and when needs to happen behind the scenes. During the years organising various hackathon and events, we have seen this as the ultimate tool to run a totally smooth event, both on the organizer side and the attendee side. This even helps a lot in dealing with any of the day-of situations very easily and generally makes it a much better experience for everyone involved. 

### A Run of Show includes:

* A **sleep schedule** for your team 
* **Opening Ceremony** 
  * Include details for the opening ceremony like the time the host should join the stream and ensure the platform is working as expected as well as order and expected time of speakers/presentations. 
* Schedule of **Workshops** 
* Schedule of **Sponsored Events**
* Schedule of **Mini Events**
* **Reminders to tweet** and post online about the event
* **Reminders to make announcements** about upcoming events 
* Times to **check-in with workshop presenters** 
* Time to **check-in with Judges**
* **Judges meeting** 
* **Deadline for projects** due on your submission platform 
* Deadline for **hacking ending** 
* Deadline for **judges scores due**
* Deadline to **finalize winners**
* **Closing ceremony**
  * Similarly to the opening ceremony, include extra details here for the order of speakers, and time to test the stream. 

## Run-Through with the Team

Just like a play or a wedding, itâ€™s important to rehearse your schedule once with all team members.

* **Create and distribute** a [run-of-show document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Vf9U34wsp5pklfvwDtV9yGEfm32jpmSLRa0tTWxm3m4/edit?usp=sharing) with everyone on your team. 
* **Confirm roles and report times** for each team member.
* **Walk-through the run-of-show** document on a call with your team.
  * In order to check comprehension, have the primary person responsible for each task read it and say what they need to do. 

## MLH Tips

* Keep in mind most organizers, especially team leaders, will be responsible for more than one thing
* Hackathon schedules inevitably change. Ensure that someone is responsible for updating attendees, sponsors, volunteers, mentors, and any other stakeholders of schedule changes as well as answering attendee questions in real time.
