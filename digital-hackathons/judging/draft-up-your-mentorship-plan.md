# Draft up your Mentorship Plan

As often as possible, encourage mentors to hop on voice and/or video chats with the hackers seeking help. 

Create a Discord user role for mentors and utilize a \#mentors channel for folks to post when they need help and encourage your mentors to keep a close eye on it. 

Since you arenâ€™t asking anyone to travel, you can recruit mentors from all over. Invite alumni from your school, industry professionals, and your professors to join during shifts throughout the event. Creating a Mentor a user role on Discord will allow hackers to see which mentors are online at what times. You can take this a step further by creating roles for the skills and technologies that each mentor feels comfortable mentoring on.
