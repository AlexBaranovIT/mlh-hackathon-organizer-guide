# Draft up your Mentorship Plan

As often as possible, encourage mentors to hop on voice and/or video chats with the hackers seeking help. Utilize a \#mentors channel for folks to post when they need help and encourage your mentors to keep a close eye on it. Since you arenâ€™t asking anyone to travel, you can recruit mentors from all over. Invite alumni from your school, industry professionals, and your professors to join during shifts throughout the event. Keep a live document of what mentors are online at what times, along with the skills and technologies that each of them feel comfortable mentoring on.
