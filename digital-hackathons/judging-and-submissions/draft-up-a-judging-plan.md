# Judging Plan

Structurally, we recommend having hackers submit 2 minute videos on your submission platform for the judges to review. Make sure they put a lot of love and care into their submission. Their video should be a demo of their hack, not a presentation.

To avoid confusion, the key is to **make sure hackers know exactly where you are in the schedule for judging.** Tell them you’re advancing to the next stage of judging when you do, or if judging is taking longer than expected, tell them how far along you are. Giving quick updates like “Our judges have reviewed about 50% of the projects!” goes a long way in keeping hackers engaged.

For judging structure, assign judges out as you would at a regular hackathon. We always recommend you moderate judges to ensure they don’t take too much time to review each project, so getting them into a Google Hangout or voice chat to time keep them is strongly encouraged. They should watch their demo video and review their submission within 5 minutes and move on to the next project.

If you wish to do second round judging with their top picks, doing so is relatively easy. Get the hackers on the team of the project to hop on a call with the judges for further questions — this is the time for the judge to get more in-depth with the project, and fill in any ambiguity that might have existed in their submission.
