# Promoting your Event

Marketing your hackathon is another one of the major areas of focus one has while planning it out. The aim here is to reach as many people as possible with the focus on the right audience meant for the event. But before that, it is necessary to evaluate your target community and region as the focus of marketing. You can have a hackathon in your local community, city and extend it to your state, country and even abroad. With digital events specifically, there are no boundaries, and the best part, people don't need to spend anything on travelling! Written below are certain strategies that might help you promote your event.

### Hackathon Marketing Strategies

* **Invite students from other schools to attend**
  * Look at schools that have previously hosted MLH hackathons
  * Look at other schools in your area/region
  * Don’t overlook community colleges — they’re often full of eager and  promising participants
* **Reach out to student groups and departments on all campuses**
  * Groups: ACM & IEEE, SWE, SHPE, etc.
  * Departments: Computer Science, Design, Engineering, Applied Mathematics, Physics, Business Studies 
    * Professors and Resource Hubs on campus may be willing to share things out to their students. Some may even offer extra credit to their students for attending your event!
  * Think of other clubs or departments that may hold students interested in the other side of hacking \(i.e. project management, design, UX, etc\) such as entrepreneurship, communication, graphic design, and many more!
* **Launch a Social Media campaign**
  * Make a Facebook Page, Twitter, Instagram & LinkedIn account.
    * Consider having targetted Facebook or Instagram Ads. These are cheap and effective!
  * Invite and connect to all your friends and members of on and off-campus hacker groups. Check out the [Florida Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/floridahackers), [Hackathon Hackers](https://www.facebook.com/groups/hackathonhackers) for some examples.
  * Ask other hackathons to tweet or post about you. 
  * Reach out different community members to partner with your hackathon! The goto examples for these can be your local [GitHub Campus Experts](https://githubcampus.expert/), [Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors](https://studentambassadors.microsoft.com/), [Google Developer Groups](https://developers.google.com/community/gdg), [Facebook Developer Circles](https://developers.facebook.com/developercircles/), etc.
* **Get some pre-event press coverage**
  * Tell your school’s paper
  * Reach out to your local media outlets
  * Try reaching out to different startup/ media agencies for potential partnership.
