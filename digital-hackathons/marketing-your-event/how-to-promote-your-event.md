# How to Promote Your Event

Below are some strategies to promote your event. 

* Invite students from other schools to attend
  * Look at schools that have previously hosted MLH hackathons
  * Look at other schools in your area/region
  * Don’t overlook community colleges — they’re often full of eager and  promising participants
* Reach out to student groups and departments on all campuses
  * Groups: ACM & IEEE, SWE, SHPE, etc.
  * Departments: computer science, design, engineering, applied math, physics, business 
    * Professors and Resource Hubs on campus may be willing to share things out to their students. Some may even offer extra credit.
  * Think of other clubs or departments that may hold students interested in the other side of hacking \(i.e. project management, design, UX, etc\) such as entrepreneurship, communication, graphic design, and many more!
* Launch a social media campaign
  * Make a Facebook event page, twitter, and instagram account. Invite and connect to all your friends and members of on and off-campus hacker groups.

  * Ask other hackathons to tweet or post about you. 
  * Consider Facebook or Instagram ads. These are cheap and effective
* Get pre-event press coverage
  * Tell your school’s paper
  * Tell your local media outlets
