# Marketing Goals & Timelines

Because hackers do not need to make travel arrangements to attend a digital hackathon, you will likely see sign-ups rising closer to the event start that you may see at in-person events. The exciting part of this is you now have the ability to promote your event to hackers anywhere in the world!

As you plan your marketing timeline, keep in mind that you will see a dropoff rate between the number of hackers who signed up to attend your event and the number who participate. The attrition rate varies from event to event, but in general, we expect about a 50% dropoff rate for free hackathons.

In general, we recommend aiming to have 100% of your goal attendance signed up two weeks before the event and 200% of your attendance goal signed up one week in advance.

For example, if you're aiming to have 500 attendees, a good timeline may be:

* Two months before event: registration opens 
* One month before event: 100 signups 
* Three weeks before event: 250 signups 
* Two weeks before event: 500 signups 
* One week before event: 1000 signups
